# Healthcare Management System

This project is a basic simulation of a Healthcare Management System. It allows three types of users to interact with the system:

- **Administrator**
- **Doctor**
- **Patient**

Each user type has specific actions they can perform after logging in.

## Features

### 1. Administrator
Administrators have the following abilities:
- **Add User**: Register a new Doctor or Patient in the system.
- **Remove User**: Remove an existing user by their ID.
- **Generate Reports**: Generate reports for system usage.
- **Login and Update Profile**: Admins can log in and update their profile details.

### 2. Doctor
Doctors can:
- **Add Medical Records**: Add medical records for patients.
- **Login and Update Profile**: Doctors can log in and update their profile information.

### 3. Patient
Patients can:
- **Request Appointments**: Schedule an appointment with a doctor.
- **Add Medical Records**: Record their own medical history.
- **Login and Update Profile**: Patients can log in and update their profile.

## Usage

1. **Login**: Users can log in as an Administrator, Doctor, or Patient by entering their credentials.
2. **Administrator Actions**: Once logged in, the Admin can manage users (add/remove), generate reports, and update their profile.
3. **Doctor Actions**: After logging in, Doctors can add medical records for patients.
4. **Patient Actions**: Patients can request appointments with Doctors and add medical records.
5. **Exit**: You can exit the system at any time.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the program.
3. Follow the prompts in the console to log in and perform actions based on your role.
